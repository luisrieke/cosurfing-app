Little booking tool for the Digital Nomad Village Tursi.

In the long run, I also want to build a platform to find cool Coworking Spaces in Europe. A project I build in the past was [cosurfingspace.com](https://www.cosurfingspace.com/) - this was actually part of my bachelor thesis. I want to build a new version of this project with a more modern stack and a better user experience. And of course real world data this time.
